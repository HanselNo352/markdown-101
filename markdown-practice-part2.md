### Reasons programmers use markdown
1. Because it provides the necessary syntax and utility for programmers day to day work.
2. Because it is simple to edit through services like Github.

```html
{
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en"
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content=""width=device=width, initial-scale-1.0">
<title>Title of web page</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>A Size One Heading in HTML </h1>
<p>A short paragraph. </p>
<p>The second paragraph that contains the HTML <br> line break element. </p>
</body>
</html>
}
```
